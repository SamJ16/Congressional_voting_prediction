# Congressional_voting_prediction
Implementation and use of decision trees to classify congress members based on how they voted on bills, or predicting voting on bills based on party membership. This is a primitive version that does not generalize to new voting issues with the use of nltk's semantic analysis. Plus, extensive use and optimization are yet to be done. This is a work in progress.
I plan on perhaps putting this in a hidden layer of a customized neural network to optimize the minimum number of people required to make a classification/non-decision/leaf node.
Then I plan on using nltk's tools to generalize to other issues based on the issues in the bills pertaining to congress_data.csv.
This is a work in progress and is part of my learning, so any input would be gladly appreciated. Thanks.
